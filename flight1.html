    <body bgcolor="lightgreen">F-35 Lightning II is the only international fifth-generation multirole fighter plane in the world. The extreme agility and stealth features, along with an integrated sensor package and modern weaponry, provide the F-35 with a tactical edge over all other fighter aircraft.

        The single-seat fighter is armed with a range of weapon systems such as Sidewinder and Storm Shadow, as well as Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs).
        
        Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor of the F-35 while its major partners include Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems and Pratt & Whitney.
        
        The F-35 completed its maiden flight in December 2006. The three F-35 variants, including the conventional take-off and landing (CTOL), short take-off / vertical landing (STOVL) and carrier variant (CV), will replace the A-10 and F-16 of the US Air Force, the F/A-18 of the US Navy, the F/A-18 and AV-8B Harrier of the US Marine Corps and various fighters of other allied nations.</body>
