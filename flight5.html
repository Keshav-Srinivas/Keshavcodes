        Eurofighter Typhoon is a new generation multirole fighter aircraft that is presently one of the best in the world. It is a foreplane/delta wing aircraft integrating modern avionics and sensors, Defensive Aids Sub System (DASS) and distinct weapons, such as Mauser BK-27 27mm cannon, air-to-air, air-to-surface and anti-ship missiles and precision-guided munitions.

Eurofighter Typhoon’s development is Europe’s largest multinational military collaborative effort managed by the Nato Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA), which is also the prime customer.

The programme delivers cutting-edge technologies for the European defence industry.

Eurofighter Typhoon made its combat début in 2011 for reconnaissance and ground strike missions in Libya by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Italian Air Force.
