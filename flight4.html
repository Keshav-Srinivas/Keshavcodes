        The aircraft is designed to perform air superiority and attack missions primarily of the Russian Air Force and the Russian Navy. It can defend all types of ground, air and surface targets of the enemy and monitor the airspace at longer ranges.
        
        With a combat weight of 10t, the aircraft can carry short-range air-to-air missiles, air-to-surface missiles such as X-31, X-35, X-38, X-58, X-59, short and medium-range guided and unguided weapons, and aerial bombs in 250kg, 500kg, and 1,500kg classes.
        
        The aircraft made its first flight in January 2010 and is currently in the final flight testing phase. It is expected to be introduced by the Russian Air Force in 2019, replacing the existing fleet of Su-27 fourth-generation fighter. </body>
