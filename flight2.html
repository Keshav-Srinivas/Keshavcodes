    <p>The F-22 Raptor developed by Lockheed Martin and Boeing is a single-seat, twin-engine fifth-generation extremely advanced tactical fighter. The stealth, integrated avionics and superior performance make the F-22 a super-manoeuvrable fighter.

        Inducted by the US Air Force (USAF) as an air-superiority fighter, the F-22 evolved into multi-mission fighter aircraft.
        
        The Raptor made its first flight in September 1997. <br>
        The first production F-22 was delivered to Nellis Air Force Base in January 2003. The aircraft formally entered USAFâ€™s service in December 2005. The F-22 Raptor employs sophisticated air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. The emerging technologies integrated aboard the F-22 make it a superior platform for a wide array of missions, including surveillance, reconnaissance, attack, electronic warfare and signals intelligence. </p>
